# ng2-tour-of-heroes-refactored
I started learning AngularJS three years ago when i started as a frontend developer
for the product [Relution](http://relution.io). When i started, the product was relatively new
and i could enter almost uncharted waters. The codebase of the application was 
obviously growing over time and soon we had to deal with decisions that we took in early stages.
As it is a product we could not start from scratch but we had to refactor our codebase to
keep it scalable for the future. Some of the refactorings had a bigger impact and could not be
done in a day. As there was the request for new features some of the refactorings had to be done
in parallel. This was sometimes a hard task to do so.

Anyway, as Google decided to develop the version AngularJS 2 that to not make it backwards compatible to 
Angular 1, i had to face the truth that i have to start from the beginning (again).
Besides all the new stuff that the AngularJS team has thrown into the boat like
TypeScript, Observables and of course AngularJS itself, some of things started looking familiar.

I started with the official [AngularJS tutorial](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/tutorial/). When i
had finished it, i decided to apply the lessons that i have learned with angular 1.
So i'm going to refactor the codebase.

git checkout tags/1-tour-of-heroes
```
This will checkout out the revision how it has looked like after i finished the tutorial


## Run it
```
